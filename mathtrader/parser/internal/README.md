# Internal Parser

Implements a stateful `InternalParser` that takes at its input "official wants"
files generated by the
[Online Want List Generator](https://bgg.activityclub.org/olwlg/) (OLWLG) and
produces a series of `mathtrader::Wantlist` objects.

The internal parser should not be used to parse more than one file and is not
intended to be used as the public API for this purpose.

This directory declares and implements:

1. `InternalParser`: entry point to the code that parses OLWLG files.
1. `ItemParser`: sub-module that parses lines declaring official item names.
1. `WantlistParser`: sub-module that parses lines declaring wantlists.
