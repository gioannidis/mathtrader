// Defines a directed graph representing the following trade scenario.
// Users U1, U2, and U3 offer items for trade. U1 and U2 offer 5 items each,
// while U3 offers only a single item. There are two distinct trade scenarios:
//
// 1. Maximize trading items: users U1 and U2 trade all their items with each
//    other. U3 does not trade. Only 1 item is not traded.
//
// 2. Maximize trading users: U1 trades 3 items, U2 trades 2 items, U3 trades
//    their single item. All users trade. 5 items are not traded.
