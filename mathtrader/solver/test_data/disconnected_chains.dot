// Defines a directed graph representing the following trade scenario.
// Users U1, U2, U3, U4, and U5 offer items for trade. U5 offers a single item,
// all other users offer 2 items each. U1, U2, U3, and U4 always trade at least
// one item. There are two distinct scenarios for the rest of the items:
//
// 1. Maximize trading items: users U1, U2, U3, and U4 trade their second items,
//    forming a large chain. U5 does not trade. Only 1 item is not traded.
//
// 2. Maximize trading users: U1 trades 2 items, all others trade 1 item each.
//    All users trade. 3 items are not traded.
