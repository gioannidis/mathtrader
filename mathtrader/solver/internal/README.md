# Constraint Programming Model

This directory defines and implements `TradeModel`, a wrapper around the
OR-Tools `CpModelBuilder`. This class exposes APIs to facilitate the
construction of a `CpModelBuilder` that defines the necessary variables,
constraints, and objective functions to solve the math trade problem.
